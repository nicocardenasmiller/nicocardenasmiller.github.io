<h2>Welcome!</h2>
My name is Nicolás Cárdenas-Miller. I hold Bachelors of Science degrees at <a href="https://www.psu.edu/">the Pennsylvania State University, University Park</a> in Economics and Political Science. Currently I am a PhD student in Political Science at the <a href="https://politicalscience.unc.edu/">University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</a>. 
<br/>
<br/>
I study Comparative Political Economy. Specifically, I am interested in looking at the ways in which firm changes and trade affect political ideology in Latin America. My previous research has examined Chilean political ideology, visual attention and memory, and vowel illusions in L2 speech perception. My work in visual attention and memory has been published in the <em>Memory and Cognition Journal</em> in 2023. 
<br/>
<br/>
My passions outside of academics include climbing, long distance running, and playing guitar.
